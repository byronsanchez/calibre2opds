                      DevNote - Catalog file naming conventions
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                      
This note specifies the naming standard for generating files within the catalog and sub-catalogs

RULES:
1.  All filename sshould be unique
2.  Files are organised into directories where the directory name corresponds to the start of the
    filename.   This is primarily for performance by avoiding having very large number of files in
    the same folder.  It is also convenient if you ever peruse the catalog at the file elvel.
3.  Direcories will never be more than one level deep.
4.  The top level folder will only contain generic files
3.  When generating sublevels a Prefix is added to the folder and file names.
    This prefix should be consistent for all files/folders at the same catalog level
    

Details:
~~~~~~~
author/					Folder for Files for each author
	author_nn			Files for a given author listing series/books
					(we suppress pagination within an author although this could be changed)
	author_nn_series_nn_Page_nn	Files listing book for a given series for that author

book/					folder for details about individual books
	book_nn				File for a book with id nn
	
serie/					Folder for files for each series
	serie_nn_Page_nn

tag/					Folder for files for each tag	
	tag_nn_Page_nn
	

Sub-catalogs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
allbooks/				Folder for allbooks sub-catalog split by letter/page
	allbooks_XX_Page_nn		Files for allbooks split-by-level
					Entries point to books in the book/ folder
					
authors/				Folder for authors sub-catalog split by letter/page
	authors_XX_Page_nn		Files for the author-by-level where XX indicates the split level 
					Point to author_nn_Page_1 entries in the author/ folder
					
series/					Folder for series sub-catalog split by letter/page
	series_XX_Page_nn
	
tags/					Folder for tags sub-catalog split by letter/page
	tags_XX_Page_nn			Files for tags split by letter
	
rated/					Folder for rated books sub-catalog. 
	rated_XXXX_Page_nn		Files for the list of books at given rating levels (XXX is rating)
	
recent/					Folder for recent books sub-catalog.
	recent_XXXX_Page_nn		Files for list of books in each period (XXX is period)
	
featured/				Folder for featured books sub-catalog split by page
	featured_Page_nn		Files for list of books in the featured list
	
XXXXXXX/				Custom catalog sub-folder
	XXXXXX_YY_Page_nn
	
Custom Catalogs that generate additional levels via a search will have a Prefix
generated and added to the start of all folder names.   As we need the prefix
to be consistent across runs, the prefix is generated using CRC32 on the breadcrumbs.

e.g.
ABCDEFGH_allbooks/	
	ABCDEFGH_allbooks_XX_Page_nn
etc.

Tags that generate additional levels are treated as a special case of custom folders

If file encryption is active, then a (8 hex character) random value is added to the start of the 
folder (and the index file).  This should keep all related folders and files together while still
keeping sufficient obfustication to avaoid it being easy to guess the correct path to any particular file
