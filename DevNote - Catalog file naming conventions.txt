                      DevNote - Catalog file naming conventions
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                      
This note specifies the naming standard for generating files within the catalog and sub-catalogs

RULES:
1.  Direcories will never be more than one level deep.
2.  The top level will only contain generic files
3.  When generating sublevels a Prefix is added to the folder and file names.
    This prefix should be consistent for all files/folders at the same catalog level
    

allbooks/				Folder for allbooks catalog split by letter
	books_XX_Page_nn		Files for allbooks split-by-level
					Entries point to books in the book/ folder
					
authors/				Folder for authors split by letter
	authors_XX_Page_nn		Files for the author-by-level where XX indicates the split level 
					Point to author_nn_Page_1 entries in the author/ folder
					
author/					Folder for Files for each author
	author_nn_Page_nn		Files for a given author listing series/books
	author_nn_Series_nn_Page_nn	Files for a given series for that author
	
series/
	series_XX_Page_nn
	
serie/
	serie_nn_Page_nn
	
tags/					Folder for tags split by letter
	tags_XX_Page_nn			Files for tags split by letter
	
tag/					Folder for files for each tag	
	tag_nn_Page_nn

rated/
	rated_XXXX_Page_nn
	
recent/
	recent_XXXX_Page_nn
	
featured/
	featured_Page_nn
	
Custom Catalogs that genreate additional levels via a search will have a Prefix
generated and added to the start of all folder and file names.

e.g.
ABCDEFGH_allbooks/	
	ABCDEFGH_books_XX_Page_nn
etc.

Tags that generate additional levels are treated as a special case of custom folders

If file encryption is active, then a (12 hex character) random value is added to the folder/filename
either before the _Page_nn part or the file extension of the _Page_nn part is missing.
