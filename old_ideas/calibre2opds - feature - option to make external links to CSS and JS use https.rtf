\
When I put the produced web pages on a secure site (i'm using my windows home server) \
and I browse with ie to any of the pages I get an error "Do you want to view only the web page content delivered securly..."\
\
This is because the links to jquery are specified with http rather than https, is there an option that I am missing that would allow the generation of the page with https links to jquery?\
\
If not could this be included in a future release?\
