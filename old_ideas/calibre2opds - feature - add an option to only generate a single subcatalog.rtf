\f0\fs28 \cf0 \CocoaLigature0 add an option to only generate a single subcatalog ; or simply one that would not generate the crosslinks between catalogs.\
add some randomness in the file names, though, if you think that it may be useful. This way, the links will point to the correct files, but with the links severed, there will be no way of guessing the other subcatalog file names...\
It is a juggling act to make the tool accessible to anyone without making it too complex. Being able to generate a standalone Stanza catalog for a specific tag would probably be the best option. That way it wouldn't interfere with the normal operation of the script, but I could add a special tag to the book(s) I wanted to make available and "publish" that.\
