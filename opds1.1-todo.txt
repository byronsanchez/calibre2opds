List of things to do for OPDS 1.1 compatibility
-----------------------------------------------

1. Facets
http://opds-spec.org/2011/06/14/faceted-search-browsing/
Difficult to implement in our staticly generated catalog, but Hadrien thinks that with a little imagination, we could 
find a way to use this concept. For example, generate several catalogs for each tag, facetted to sort by title or date.

2. Featured books
http://opds-spec.org/2011/06/15/creating-a-better-opds-catalog-root/
We can easily add a link to the recent books catalog, in the main catalog. This way, modern clients could display a 
specific widget (for example, Aldiko shows a scrollable carousel) on the same screen where the main catalog is rendered.

<link type="application/atom+xml;profile=opds-catalog;kind=acquisition" title="Featured Books" rel="http://opds-spec.org/featured" href="link-to-our-recent-books-catalog"/>

Maybe a reduced, specific, custom catalog could be generated instead; I would like to see my books tagged "Interest:5" or "Interest:4" featured, for example...

3. Update the compatibility tricks mechanism
Most of the clients supporting OPDS 1.1 will not be needing the old compatibility tricks that we implemented for them before.
A notable exception is Stanza, RIP... 
However, it would be good to check every special case we programmed for specific compatibility, and see if it's still needed.
Specifically, see with Aldiko team if the reltype=http://opds-spec.org/cover trick is still needed

4. opds:// protocol
Add a HTML link in our HTML catalog, pointing to the OPDS catalog. Easy !

Well, not so easy because the OPDS catalog url should not be relative... POSTPONED

5. Use the new "kind" attribute in our links
http://opds-spec.org/specs/opds-catalog-1-1-20110627/#The_OPDS_Kind_Parameter
The complete media type for a relation to an Acquisition Feed SHOULD be: application/atom+xml;profile=opds-catalog;kind=acquisition
The complete media type for a relation to a Navigation Feed SHOULD be: application/atom+xml;profile=opds-catalog;kind=navigation

6. Correct the rel attributes used in the breadcrumb
We're not allowed to use values for this attribute that are not listed in the RFC : http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988
Hadrien suggests that we post on the OPDS mailing list, because he says that our breadcrumb system may interest other. I doubt it...
In the examples (http://opds-spec.org/specs/opds-catalog-1-1-20110627/#Feed_Examples) we can find :
  <link rel="self"    
        href="/opds-catalogs/unpopular.xml"
        type="application/atom+xml;profile=opds-catalog;kind=acquisition"/>
  <link rel="start"   
        href="/opds-catalogs/root.xml"
        type="application/atom+xml;profile=opds-catalog;kind=navigation"/>
  <link rel="up"      
        href="/opds-catalogs/root.xml"
        type="application/atom+xml;profile=opds-catalog;kind=navigation"/>
 
With "self" being the current catalog, "start" being the root page and "up" is the navigation to the upper level.

7. In the type attribute
No need to specify "type=feed", it's the default in AtomPub

8. Artwork relations
http://opds-spec.org/specs/opds-catalog-1-1-20110627/#Artwork_Relations
We specify old relation types (pre-opds 1.0), we must change this :
"http://opds-spec.org/image": a graphical Resource associated to the OPDS Catalog Entry
"http://opds-spec.org/image/thumbnail": a reduced-size version of a graphical Resource associated to the OPS Catalog Entry

9. Book metadata
Hadrien suggests using dedicated attributes to specify the book metadata, for example dcterms:publisher for the publisher and 
atom:category for the tags, instead of putting all in the book comment. He says that, this way, client applications can use this 
information even in the partial entries...

10. Counters
He also suggests that the links with a counter (568 in ...) could also be enhanced with a thr:count attribute.


11. Something abount navigation links that I don't understand (I required clarification and I'll update the document asap)
Dans les flux de navigation, on conseille de mettre rel="subsection" sur les liens des entrées qu'on ne peut pas qualifier de manière plus précise

12. Check the value of the rel attribute
There are specific rel attribute values that could be used in the catalog to better qualify some of our links.

http://opds-spec.org/specs/opds-catalog-1-1-20110627/#OPDS_Catalog_Relations

13. Refer to the user library in ALL feeds
It should be better to add a link in all the catalogs (feeds) pointing to a full (all books), time-descending sorted catalog.
