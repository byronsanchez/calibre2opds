There is a link to this from the main Calibre2Opds GUI via the Help
button.  It is also included in the Calibre2Opds catalogs at the top
level.  User areencouraged to pass back suggestions for enhancments
to reflect their experience of using Calibre2Opds.

The #number type references in these notes refer to the bug number
entries for calibre2opds in the calibre2opds Issue register that is at:
   http://calibre2opds.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/

Localizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Calibre2Opds application is designed to make it easy to be
localized to languages other than English.  However to do so, input
is required from those who can speak those languages to provide the
correct localization text.  This is not a task that requires
programming skills, so users are encouraged to contribute their
expertise in this area.  The details on how to go about this can be
found at:
  http://calibre2opds.com/read-the-documentation/development/localization/

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following issues are known to be outstanding in this release.  More detail can be found by
looking at the calibre2opds issue register (http://calibre2opds.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/)
 - #627926  Publish mode limiting formats allowed (will be fixed by #c2o-93)
 - #729859  Internal links not working in XML catalogs
            (may not be fixable as it tends to be a limitation of the OPDS clients)
 - #c2o-15  Filenames generated can exceed system limits
            (this is particularly likely to happen in the larger catalog sections on very large
            libraries, or if many sub-levels based on tags are specified).  The avoidance actio is
            to ensure that the Maximum Number of Split Levels option is set to a small value (e.g. 3)
 - #c2o-94: Trook compatibility (lack of Nook+Trook hindering investigation)
 - #c2o-86: Incorrect Mime type for FB2 files (will be fixed by #c2o-93)
 - #c2o-100: Uninstall does not work under Windows 7

 - Localization: The current localizations now have significant gaps until users can provide the 
            required translation strings for the large number of new messages introduced in v3.0.

      - added options to disable the "Ratings" and "All books" catalog
      - added a Help button to the GUI
      - moved the thumbnails into a subfolder
      - the data model is preloaded before the catalogs are generated (removes the overhead on the first generated catalog)

      - added an option to specify a tag that assigns a language to a book ; this is used to sort in a language dependent way
      - enhanced the sorting and splitting of the authors (case insensitive sort, spaces do not count)
