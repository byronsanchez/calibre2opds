                      DevNote - Compatibility Modes
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a note on the different compatibility modes that are supported by calibre2opds and
any deviations from the OPDS standard that are used in these modes:

OPDS
~~~~
This should conform to the latest OPDS standard.
The current release of this standard is 1.0, and 1.1 is available in draft

Calibre2opds tries to support the full standard when in OPDS compatibility mode.

Stanza
~~~~~~
Stanza was implemented against an early draft of the original OPDS standard.
It embodies most of the basic concepts, but cannot handle many of the more
detailed features that became part of the final OPDS standard.

As Stanza was the first widely available reader to support this standard,
many web sites conform to this implementation.  As a result there are
other ereader packages around that also support this subset of OPDS.
This makes this compatibility mode important in terms of reaching the
widest available audience.   Also most software that conforms to the
full OPDS standard also seems to work with the Stanza sub-set.
